This release should be viewed in the following order (3 Steps):

**Step 1:**

The Data Collection/Creation, which can be viewed in the 'Data Collection/Creation folder'. It contains the 7 files that make up the whole data collection process. In order to create the final "supermarket_data.csv" file for the modeling, we followed the following process:
